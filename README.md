## The Decaffeinated Panda
This Point-Of-Sale Website is a basic, self-service application for a consumer-driven business called the Decaffeinated Panda.

## Motivation
As a team, our group designed an intentionally simple, and easily navigated interface that prioritizes the user experience, focusing on responsiveness and accessibility, in order to create a POS website that could be used by both an online shopper and an in-person vendor.
